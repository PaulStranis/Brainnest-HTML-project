    <h2>Drum Anatomy:</h2>
    <p>
      Drums consist of at least one membrane, called a drumhead, that is
      stretched over a shell and usually a resonant head on the underside of the
      drum. <br /><br />

    <h2>Drums configuration:</h2>
    <p>
      Drums may be played individually, with the player using a single drum, and
      some drums such as the djembe

      />
      are almost always played in this way.
      <br />
      Others are normally played in a set of two or more, all played by the one
      player, such as bongo drums

      />
      and timpani.
      <br />
      A number of different drums together with cymbals form the basic modern
      drum kit.
